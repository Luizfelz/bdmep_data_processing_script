### **Context**

The use of renewable sources is extremely important given the climate change scenario that the world is facing. The Brazilian energy matrix consists of many renewable sources for energy generation, but unfortunately these sources depend on some climatic variables, such as temperature, rainfall, wind speed, radiation, and many others. In this context, the study of climate variables is essential, however the exorbitant amount of raw data to be analyzed makes it necessary to use tools capable of performing this function quickly and effectively. The use of algorithms for processing databases is quite common and has grown significantly in recent years, even more so when considering the more frequent use of programming languages to perform and automate tasks that were previously performed manually.

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a high-level programming language and one of the most used for database processing, as in addition to allowing its algorithms to be light and fast, it allows a easy creation and interpretation of sequences of logical commands that will be used to process raw data.

The [Meteorological Database](https://bdmep.inmet.gov.br/) of the [National Institute of Meteorology](https://portal.inmet.gov.br/) (BDMEP - INMET) is a digital database that groups meteorological data from historical series from automatic and conventional meteorological stations, in accordance with international technical standards from the [World Meteorological Organization](https://news.un.org/pt/tags/organizacao-meteorologica-mundial).

### **Objective**

The objective of this project is to create an algorithm capable of processing raw data taken from BDMEP. The algorithm and executable are still under development and, eventually, new versions will be available if necessary.
